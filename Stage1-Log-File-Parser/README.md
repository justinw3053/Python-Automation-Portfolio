# Stage 1: Log File Parser

## Project Description
This project focuses on basic Python scripting for file I/O and data parsing. The goal is to develop scripts that can read and process information from various text files, such as log files and CSV files. This is a foundational skill for any automation or DevOps role, as it is a common requirement to parse logs for errors or to extract specific data for reporting.

## Scripts
### `parser.py`
A simple Python script that reads a log file and extracts information based on a specific pattern. It demonstrates basic file reading and string manipulation.

### `server_health.py`
This script reads a list of servers from `servers.txt` and checks their status. It uses basic conditional logic and file handling to simulate a server health check.

### `user_accounts.py`
Reads user account information from a CSV file (`users.csv`) and performs basic data processing and reporting. It showcases how to work with structured data in Python.

## How to Use
To run any of the scripts, navigate to the `Stage1-Log-File-Parser` directory in your terminal and execute the desired script:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
````

For example:

Bash

```
python3 parser.py
```
